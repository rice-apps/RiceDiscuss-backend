## Getting started

Before starting, ask a RiceApps team lead for access to this repository.

First, clone this repository. Open your terminal and run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rice-apps/RiceDiscuss-backend.git
```

Create a new branch, preferably naming it after yourself or the feature you're working on.

```
$ git checkout -b <your branch name>
```

To install dependencies into a local `node_modules` folder, run

```
$ npm install
```

If you do not have node and npm installed, install them from [the NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Finally, create a remote for your branch on github by running

```
$ git push -u origin <your branch name>
```

Happy coding!
